# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer:
  Props is short for properties. They are used to pass the arguments/data from one component to another (from parent component to children components).

  Researched answer:
  Props is short for properties and they are used to pass data between React components. React’s data flow between components is uni-directional (from parent to child only).



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer:
  The interactions between the user and brower when the user makes changes on a webpage. For example; when the user scrolls the mouse up and down or clicks a send button on a webpage. 

  Researched answer:
  DOM (Document Object Model) Events are a signal that something has occurred, or is occurring, and can be triggered by user interactions or by the browser.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer:
  Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming language that bases on objects. It contains data, code and method. 
  Function programming emphasizes on the use of functions where each function performs a specific task but OOP is based on object oriented concept. Classes are used where instance of objects are created

  Researched answer:
  Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects. There are many object-oriented programming languages including Ruby, C++, Java, and Python.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer:
  A Float is not a rounded number and it always has decimal point like 20.22 and an Interger is a rounded number without decimal point like 20 (without .22)
  We could use a float when we need more accurate result.

  Researched answer:
  Integers and floats are two different kinds of numerical data. An integer (more commonly called an int) is a number without a decimal point. A float is a floating-point number, which means it is a number that has a decimal place. Floats are used when more precision is needed.


5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer:
  Every block in Ruby always return the value of the last line. We don't need to use the return keyword.

  Researched answer:
  Any statement in Ruby returns the value of the last evaluated expression. A simple example is the getter method. We call a method and expect some value in return.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable:
An instance variable is a type of variable which starts with an @ symbol.
It is used as part of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to give objects their own private space to store data.

2. PostgreSQL:
PostgreSQL is an advanced, enterprise-class, and open-source relational database system. PostgreSQL supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying.
It is used as a primary database for many web applications as well as mobile and analytics applications.

3. Ruby on Rails:
Ruby on Rails, or Rails, is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as JSON or XML for data transfer and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for user interfacing. 

4. ORM:
ORM is Object Relational Mapper. Map database contents to Ruby objects. It means you don't have to manually call the database yourself; the ORM handles it for you. 

5. Active Record:
Rails Active Record is the Object Relational Mapping (ORM) layer supplied with Rails. It closely follows the standard ORM model, which is as follows ..
- tables map to classes,
- rows map to objects and
- columns map to object attributes.
Rails Active Records provide an interface and binding between the tables in a relational database and the Ruby program code that manipulates database records. Ruby method names are automatically generated from the field names of database tables.
